# ColorSearcher
This application creates a database of colors with RAL code, RGB value and CMYK value. Than with a search permits to resolve the RAL code in the others values of the color.
It's not finished and there is a limited number of colours at the moment, but being open scource it can be easily customized.

Compatibility
- It runs well and smooth on window with the exe file.
- Tecnically speaking it can run even on macOS with the rush.sh in the target directory but it requires java on the computer.
